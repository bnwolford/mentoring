## Datasets
There are many free datasets online, this website and for example this:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset

The package `datasets` has many and they are already downloaded to RStudio.

Most packages have datasets included in them, and they are made particularly to fit that package the best. 

For example, if you download the package `survival` (used for survival analysis) and click on the package you can scroll down among the descriptions of the different functions belonging to that package, and find a dataset called “cancer”, which includes many different variables to practice survival analysis on.

## Common packages
