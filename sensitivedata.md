There are differences in how personal data should be processed in a student project, a research project, or in administrative case processes. 
The main summary page is in Norwegian [here](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/Personvern+og+GDPR)\

*Training*
NTNU has created a series of short videos that address the processing of personal data. You can find 'Introduction to personal data in health research projects' a [45 min course from NTNU](https://digit.ntnu.no/courses/course-v1:NTNU+NTNU-UB+2024_FEB/about) with Norwegian captions. This is required for applying to funding for Samarbeidsorganet.

*DPIA*
A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is intended to ensure that the privacy of those who are registered (e.g., students, employees, research participants) is properly safeguarded. This is a requirement of the GDPR. To assess whether your project requires a DPIA, take a look here: Assessing privacy implications - Knowledge base - NTNU
MH has a checklist for assessing the need for a DPIA and a separate DPIA template.
The DPIA must be assessed at the department and signed by the department head. At ISM, the DPIA is sent for assessment by email to: <personvern@ism.ntnu.no>.

*Health research*
Projects that fall under the Health Research Act must have valid REK approval. If you want to use data from health registries or health surveys, you must apply for this from the respective sources. If you need advice or assistance, please contact the research advisor.
 
*Report projects to SIKT*
Research projects that do not fall under the Health Research Act but that deal with personal data must be reported to SIKT.
SIKT assesses whether the project needs to perform a DPIA, and this is done in the Sikt portal as needed.
 
*Personal data and student projects*
If you have students (or are a student) who will be processing personal data in their projects, we recommend starting here: Personal data in student projects [training](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/Persondata+i+studentprosjekt) (in Norwegian)
 ). You will find a link to the page on processing personal data in student and research projects, as well as a teaching plan to help students get started.

*Data storage*
Different types of data have different storage requirements. Use NTNU's storage guide to find the solution that best suits you and your project.
[Data storage guide](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Data+storage+guide)

*Sharing data with others*
Remember that if you are going to share data with a partner or a data processor, you must have an agreement in place.  The type of agreement you need depends on the relationship between you. If you are unsure, contact your research advisor.
Check [here](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/Norsk/Overføring+av+personopplysninger+-+avtalemaler) for an overview of agreement templates
