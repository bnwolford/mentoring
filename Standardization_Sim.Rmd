#make a messy distribution by mixing normal and uniform
x<-rnorm(100,mean=20,sd=100)
y<-runif(100)*100

###standardize (substracts mean and divides by sd)
### makes mean of 0 and variance of 1
scaled<-scale(a)
hist(scaled)
mean(scaled)
var(scaled)
sd(scaled)

### min max normalization
minMax <- function(x) {
  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
}
mm<-minMax(a)
hist(mm)
mean(mm)
var(mm)
sd(mm)

### rank based inverse normal transformation
### https://yingji15.github.io/2019-08-17-inverse-normal-transformation/
### makes mean of 0 and variance of 1 while also making the distribution normal 
ranked<-RankNorm(a)
hist(ranked)
mean(ranked)
var(ranked)
sd(ranked)
